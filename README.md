The w3schools website has helped me a lot to advance in frontend development. I made a clone version of the w3schools website to apply what I learned at w3schools. I styled the page using "scss" and added dropdown menus using JavaScript. The page is responsive for all devices. You can see the page I cloned from the w3schools website at the link below:<br>
